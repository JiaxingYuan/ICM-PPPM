# ICM-PPPM
The ICM-P3M is an efficient approach for simulating charged particle systems confined between two planar dielectric interfaces. Currently, we have implemented the ICM-P3M into the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package (stable versions of 3Mar2020, 7Aug2019, 12Dec2018, and 31Mar2017; 31Mar2017 is the extensively tested version). To use the code, one simply needs to replace the corresponding files in the unmodified LAMMPS code, and then compile LAMMPS as in the normal way.
